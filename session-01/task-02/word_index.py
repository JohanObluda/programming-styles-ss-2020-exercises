# Word Index is a program that takes a plain text file as input and outputs all the words contained in it
# sorted alphabetically along with the page numbers on which they occur. The program assumes that a page is a
# sequence of 45 lines, each line has max 80 characters, and there is no hyphenation. Additionally, Word Index
# must ignore all words that occur more than 100 times.

# Global variables

LINES_PER_PAGE = 45
MAX_SIZE_LINE = 80
