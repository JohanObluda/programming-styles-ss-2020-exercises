Agenda

	- Register on HISQIS
		- Before 10/05/2020
		- MES

	- Organization of the Assignment
		- Create an Assignment -> I cannot change it
			- keep the assignment to a minimum (brief task + skeleton)
			- Public repos (that you are suggested to import as submodule)
				- public-tests - live/community driven
				- program-descriptions  - live/community driven
				-> You have to pull the changes from the submodules
			- Private tests

			- you need to pull frequently so you can see the test reports

		- TODO: Double check the deadline (15/05/2020 - 23:59 PM +02:00),
			POST on home page

	>> How DO YOU test your programs?
 		DO NOT NECESSARILY RELY ON JUST PUBLIC TESTS


	- How run to tests locally
		- Test environment on Windows
			- Running WSL
		- You can use your "own" setup
		- You can use this run-test.sh -> .bat/.ps1 (Powershell)
		- "Import" the tests into your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ)

	- Automatic test execution

 - Task 2: Implementation
	- Implement Word Index (Python + Monolithic)
	- Write test cases
